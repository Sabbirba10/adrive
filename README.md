### WebDAV endpoint

You can use any client (such as [Cx File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer), [BD File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liuzho.file.explorer))
that supports the WebDAV protocol to access your files.
Fill the endpoint URL as `https://<domain-url>/webdav` and use the username and password you set.

However, the standard WebDAV protocol does not support large file (â‰¥128MB) uploads due to the limitation of Cloudflare Workers.
You must upload large files through the web interface which supports chunked uploads.
